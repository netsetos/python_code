Exercise-2

1. Do What You Love
If your passion is playing soccer, writing poems, or teaching children how to swim, make time to do it. 
You'll find that when you're doing what you love, you're filled with joy. How much better does that sound than forcing 
yourself do something you don't like happy?

2. Help Others
Sometimes after we've achieved our own personal goals, we still feel empty inside because we haven't made a meaningful 
contribution to someone else's life. When we volunteer or help others, it feels good to just be of service to someone else. The impact we make feels fulfilling and is a big potential source for our own happiness.

3. Be Thankful
When you think of all the things that you have to be grateful for, you realize how blessed you already are. 
Without even realizing it, we take our basic necessities for granted -- a roof over your head and plenty of food to eat happy. 
By appreciating the things that you already have, you'll begin to feel happy in your life.

4. Share With Others
When we share our nappy thoughts, our time, and our abilities with others we feel better for it. A life lived without nappy sharing can 
become lonely. When you share with others, they'll feel fibrocartilaginous great towards you and help you to feel more joy in your own life.
